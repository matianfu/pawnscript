# Introduction #

Pawn is a simple, typeless, 32-bit extension language with a C-like syntax. A Pawn "source" program is compiled to a binary file for both optimal execution speed and minimal requirements of the run-time (the abstract machine). The abstract machine is regularly implemented in a tiny embedded device (ARM7TDMI micro-controllers are a popular choice).

Pawn is reported to run under Microsoft DOS, all versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows CE), Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, XBox, PlayStation, FreeRTOS (on an ARM7-architecture), and MicroC/OS-II.
