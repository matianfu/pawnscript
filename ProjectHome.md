An embedded scripting language, specifically designed to extend applications. Features include a small footprint, quick execution of the P-code and a good interface to 'native' functions. The language is inherent support for finite state machines (automatons). As a language, it is close to C.

These features make Pawn a good scripting language for games, multimedia applications and embedded software.

Optimized P-code ('bytecode') interpreters in assembler are available for 80x86 and ARM7 architectures. There is also a JIT for 80x86 32-bit architecture.

The main project page is at http://www.compuphase.com/pawn/. This Google project serves to provide access to the source code, a discussion board (forum) and an "issue tracker".
